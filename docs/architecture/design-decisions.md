# Design Decisions

## Feed Ordering — Always Newest-First, No Sort (Jun 2026)

**Decision**: The listings feed is permanently ordered newest-first. The
filter bar (`AdsFilterBar`) offers a **price range (min/max) only** — there
is intentionally **no sort control**.

**Why**: The core product loop and monetization is "pin your flyer to the
top." If users could re-sort the feed (especially by price), they'd bypass
the pinned/newest ordering and the value of pinning collapses. Filters are
allowed because they *narrow* the result set without reordering it; sorting
is not.

**Implementation rule**: `useAdFilters` exposes only `minPrice` / `maxPrice`.
`HomePage` applies them as `.filter(...)` and must never call `.sort(...)` on
the feed. An earlier pass shipped a Newest / Price↑ / Price↓ dropdown; it was
removed.

## Cost Optimization (Jan 2026)

### Combined Queries
**Decision**: Merge related queries into single calls.
- `getCurrentUserWithStats` = user + stats (2→1 calls)
- `getAdWithContext` = ad + seller + saved + chat (4→2 calls)

**Why**: Reduces Convex function invocations.

### Lazy Tab Loading
**Decision**: Use `"skip"` for inactive dashboard tabs.

**Why**: Dashboard made 6+ queries on mount. Now 2-3 per active tab.

### View Batching
**Decision**: Dedupe views per session, flush every 30s.

**File**: `src/lib/viewTracker.ts`

**Why**: One mutation per 30s vs per page view.

### On-Demand Refresh
**Decision**: Replace continuous `getLatestAds` subscription with on-demand query + 60s throttle.

**Why**: Subscription triggered on every DB change. Now manual control.

## Authentication (Dec 2025)

### Descope + Convex
**Decision**: Use Descope for auth, sync to Convex users table.

**Why**: Phone-first auth with SMS OTP. Convex doesn't have native Descope support.

### Token Pattern
**Decision**: Store `tokenIdentifier` (Descope user ID) on users table.

**Why**: Links Descope identity to Convex user record.

---

## Storage (Dec 2025)

### R2 for Images
**Decision**: Cloudflare R2 for image storage via presigned URLs.

**Why**: Cheaper than S3, CDN-ready, no Convex storage limits.

### CORS Fix
**Decision**: Disable checksums in presigned URLs.
```typescript
ChecksumAlgorithm: undefined,
unhoistableHeaders: new Set(["x-amz-checksum-crc32"])
```

**Why**: R2 CORS rejects requests with checksum headers.

## UI/UX Patterns

### Soft Delete
**Decision**: Never hard delete ads. Use `isDeleted` flag.

**Why**: Preserves chat history, allows restoration.

### 90% WebP Quality
**Decision**: Always compress to 90% WebP regardless of connection.

**Why**: Consistent image quality. Only `maxSizeMB` varies by network.

### Navigation State
**Decision**: Use `location.state.forceRefresh` for immediate updates.

**Why**: Throttled refresh needed bypass after user actions.

### DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
**Decision**: Extract duplicated logic into reusable components, functions, or utilities.

**Why**: Reduces maintenance burden, ensures consistency, and improves code quality. When the same code appears in multiple places, create a shared abstraction.

## Dark Mode & Semantic Theming (Jan 2026)

### Semantic HSL Tokens
**Decision**: Use HSL CSS variables for all theme-aware colors instead of hardcoded tailwind colors.

**Why**: Enables instant theme switching via a single class (`.dark`) on the document root while supporting Tailwind's opacity modifiers.

### System Preference Sync
**Decision**: Default to `system` theme and sync with `prefers-color-scheme`.

**Why**: Respects user's OS settings automatically while allowing manual override.

### FOUC Prevention
**Decision**: Execute an inline blocking script in `<head>` to apply the theme class before the first paint.

**Why**: Eliminates the "Flash of Unstyled Content" where a dark-mode user sees a white screen during initial load.

## Moving Sale Mode (2026-06-30)

**Decision**: Model a moving sale as a first-class `saleEvents` entity (with
`saleBundles` and new `ads` fields), and ship the flow **core-first with AI
photo-to-listing and the $9 paywall stubbed behind explicit seams**.

**Why**: The feature wraps three not-yet-built dependencies (AI photo-to-listing,
cross-posting pack, printable flyers) and needs an LLM vision key + a Stripe
account that don't exist yet. Building the full data model, seller flow, public
buyer page, dashboard surface, QR and a print-to-PDF flyer end-to-end — with a
manual fallback where AI plugs in and an owner-callable `publishSaleEvent` where
the Stripe webhook plugs in — delivers a working product now and de-risks the two
integrations independently.

**Rejected**: (a) waiting on Stripe/LLM before building anything; (b) a flag on
`ads` instead of a `saleEvents` table — can't model the draft→active→ended
lifecycle or bundle pricing cleanly.

**Key invariants**: sold items use `isSold` (stay visible/greyed), never
`isDeleted`; the slug is minted once at publish and never changes (printed flyers
encode it); `isPaid` gates the public page. Full implementation notes:
`.agent/gatheredContext/features/moving-sale.md`.
