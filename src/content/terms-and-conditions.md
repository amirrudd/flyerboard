## 2. Role of the Platform

The Platform acts as an online marketplace facilitating connections between Users (e.g., persons who post ads and persons who respond to ads).

We are not the seller, buyer, or service provider in any transaction between Users. We do not take custody of goods, provide services, guarantee listings, or set terms of sale.

Any agreement, transaction or interaction is exclusively between Users, and you deal at your own risk.

## 3. User Accounts & Registration

You may register an account and select a password. You are responsible for all activity using your account. You must provide accurate details and keep them updated.

We may suspend or terminate accounts at our discretion (for suspected fraud, violation of these Terms, or inactivity) without liability.

## 4. User Conduct & Listings

**4.1** You represent and warrant that any Listing you post is true, accurate, not misleading and complies with all applicable Australian laws (including the Australian Consumer Law).

**4.2** You must not post Listings or content that:

- Are unlawful, infringe third-party rights, or facilitate illegal conduct.
- Contain prohibited items (for example weapons, illicit drugs, stolen goods, etc).
- Contain viruses, malicious code, or attempt unauthorised access.

**4.3** We may remove or suspend any Listing or content at our sole discretion.

By uploading your Listing content (images/text) you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, display, reproduce and distribute that content in connection with the Platform.

## 6. Payments & Fees

We may change pricing or introduce new features; changes will be notified.

## 9. Privacy & Data Security

Your use of personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy (see section below). You agree that we may collect, use and disclose your data as described in that policy.

We take reasonable steps to protect your data; however, we do not guarantee security and you use the Website at your own risk.

## 10. Governing Law & Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of [State/Territory, e.g., Victoria] and you submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of its courts.
