# Mobile UX Optimizer

This skill focuses on the "soft" aspects of mobile design: copy, hierarchy, and interaction design.

## Best Practices

### 1. Thumb-Friendly Navigation
- CTAs should be in the "bottom third" or center of the screen where thumbs can easily reach.
- Avoid placing primary actions in the top corners (hard to reach).

### 2. Punchy Microcopy
- Keep headers short (max 2-3 words on mobile).
- Use action-oriented button text ("Post Flyer" vs "Submit Information").
- Ensure font sizes are readable (min 16px for input text to prevent iOS auto-zoom).

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
- Hide non-essential information behind "Show More" or tabs.
- Use Accordions for long lists of information.

## Checklist

- [ ] Primary button is prominent and easily reachable.
- [ ] Text is concise and doesn't wrap awkwardly.
- [ ] Form labels are above inputs (top-aligned) to save horizontal space.
- [ ] Modal close buttons are large enough to hit (min 44x44px).

## Examples
