Welcome to FlyerBoard! Our goal is to be the most trusted and safest Australian platform for buying and selling second-hand goods. These guidelines are the rules for behaviour that ensure our community is safe, respectful, and reliable for everyone.

> **Important:** These Guidelines are mandatory for all Users and supplement our full Terms and Conditions. Violations may result in warnings, content removal, or permanent account suspension.

## 1. Safety and Respect

**We have zero tolerance for hatred, discrimination, harassment, or abuse.**

### Prohibited Behaviour

## 2. Content and Listing Standards

All content posted to FlyerBoard must be legal, accurate, and relevant to the marketplace.

### A. Prohibited Images & Profiles

## 3. Marketplace Trust and Honesty

Honesty is essential for second-hand transactions. Users must always represent themselves and their items truthfully.
