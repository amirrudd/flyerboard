*We are committed to protecting personal information and, where applicable, complying with the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).*

## 1. What information we collect

We collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for the operation of our online marketplace platform. This includes:

- **Account Data:** Name, email, and a **verified mobile phone number (used for login and security purposes)**.
- **Listing Data:** Images, description, price, location, and listing history.
- **Communication Data:** **Messages exchanged through the Platform's internal chat system.**
- **Transaction Data:** Information related to any fees paid for "boost" or other paid Platform features.
- **Usage Data:** IP address, browser type, device information, and activity logs on the Website.

We only collect what is required for our functions and operations.

## 2. Use of personal information

We use your information to:

- Provide and improve the Platform and its features.
- Facilitate listings and **communication between Users via the chat system.**
- Authenticate Users and manage accounts, including processing OTPs for login.
- Comply with legal obligations, including **anti-fraud measures and investigation of policy violations.**
- Send service communications and necessary administrative updates.

## 3. Disclosure of personal information

We may disclose your information to:

- **Other Users:** When you engage with a Listing (e.g., your account name is visible to the seller; your general location is disclosed to facilitate local transactions).
- **Service Providers:** Our hosting providers, **SMS/OTP service providers**, and analytics providers under confidentiality agreements.
- **Legal Authorities:** Government or regulatory bodies if required or authorised by law, including in response to a request from the **eSafety Commissioner** or law enforcement regarding harmful content.

We do not sell your personal information for direct marketing without consent.

## 4. Data Transfer & Storage

Where we disclose personal information to overseas service providers (e.g., hosting, SMS/OTP), we take reasonable steps to ensure they handle personal information consistently with APPs.

## 5. Data Security & Retention

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, or loss. However, no system is perfect; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

We do not store your payment card details. Payment processing is handled by third-party payment providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Their use of your payment information is governed by their privacy policies.

We retain your data for as long as needed to provide the Platform, comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes. This retention period may extend beyond your account deletion **to comply with anti-fraud laws or in connection with an investigation into a potential breach of these Terms.**

## 6. Access, Correction & Deletion

You may request access to your personal information, correct it, or ask for its deletion by contacting us at [email@example.com].

We will respond within a reasonable time.

## 7. Notifiable Data Breaches

We comply with the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme: if a breach is likely to cause serious harm we will notify affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) as required.

## 8. Cookies & Tracking

We use cookies and similar technologies to run and optimise the Platform. You can manage your browser settings to limit cookies, but this may affect functionality.

## 9. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under **18** without parental/guardian consent. As stated in our T&Cs, the Platform is intended for use only by persons aged 18 or older. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us and we will remove it.

## 10. Changes to this Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and will update the “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes means you consent to them.
