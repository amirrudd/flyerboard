# About FlyerBoard

## Our Story

FlyerBoard was born in 2025 from a simple frustration: existing classified platforms weren't doing enough to protect Australians from scams and fraud. As someone who experienced the anxiety of wondering whether a buyer or seller was legitimate, I knew there had to be a better way.

Based in Melbourne and serving communities across Australia, FlyerBoard is built on the belief that buying and selling second-hand goods should be **safe, simple, and trustworthy**.

## Our Mission

We're creating a safe, easy-to-use, local community platform where Australians can buy and sell with confidence. Every feature we build is designed with one question in mind: *Does this make our community safer?*

## What Makes Us Different

### 🛡️ Safety First

Trust isn't optional—it's everything. That's why we've implemented Australian phone number verification via OTP to ensure our community is local and accountable. We're also working on identity verification badges, so you'll know exactly who you're dealing with.

### 🇦🇺 Built for Australians, by Australians

FlyerBoard is proudly Australian. We understand the unique needs of our local communities, from suburban garage sales to city apartment clearouts. Our platform is designed specifically for how Australians buy and sell.

### 🚀 Modern Technology

Built with cutting-edge technology, FlyerBoard offers a fast, responsive experience whether you're on your phone, tablet, or desktop. Real-time messaging, location-based search, and intelligent image compression ensure a smooth experience every time.

## Join Our Community

We can't wait for you to use FlyerBoard and support local communities across Australia. Every time you buy or sell on our platform, you're not just making a transaction—you're making a difference.

By giving someone else's pre-loved items a second life, you're helping create a more sustainable world. Fewer items in landfills, less manufacturing waste, and more resources staying in our communities. It's a simple choice that has a powerful impact.

Together, we're building more than a marketplace. We're building a movement toward conscious consumption, community connection, and a better future for all Australians.

## Our Commitment

Every day, we're working to make FlyerBoard the most trusted platform for second-hand goods in Australia. We're committed to:

- **Zero tolerance** for scams, fraud, and unsafe behaviour
- **Continuous improvement** based on community feedback
- **Transparency** in how we operate and protect our users
- **Privacy** as a fundamental right, not an afterthought
