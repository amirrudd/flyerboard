*Operator: [Your name / company], ABN [xxxxxx], trading as FlyerBoard ("we", "our", "us", "Platform")*

*Website: https://flyerboard.com.au , https://flyerboard.au ("Website")*

*Users: Anyone who registers, posts, browses, or uses the Website ("User", "you", "your").*

## 1. Accepting these Terms

By accessing or using the Website you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Website. You acknowledge you are over **18 years of age** (or have express guardian consent).

We may update these Terms at any time; we will provide notice (via the Website or email). Continued use after changes means you accept them.

## 2. Role of the Platform and Liability Exclusion

The Platform acts solely as an online marketplace facilitating connections between Users (e.g., persons who post ads and persons who respond to ads).

We are **not the seller, buyer, or service provider** in any transaction between Users. We do not take custody of goods, provide services, guarantee Listings, or set terms of sale.

Any agreement, transaction, or interaction is exclusively between Users, and you deal **entirely at your own risk.**

We do not supervise, insure, or guarantee the quality, legality, or safety of items listed, nor the truthfulness or accuracy of Listings. **We do not participate in or supervise physical meetups, delivery arrangements, or off-Platform communication between Users.**

## 3. User Accounts & Registration

To register an account, you must provide a valid email address and a **verified mobile phone number** to receive one-time passwords (OTP) for login. You are responsible for all activity using your account. You must provide accurate details and keep them updated.

We may suspend or terminate accounts at our discretion (for suspected fraud, violation of these Terms, or inactivity) without liability.

## 4. User Conduct & Listings

**4.1** You represent and warrant that any Listing you post is true, accurate, not misleading, and complies with all applicable Australian laws (including the Australian Consumer Law).

**4.2** You must not post Listings or content that:

-   Are unlawful, infringe third-party rights, or facilitate illegal conduct.
    
-   Contain prohibited items, including but not limited to weapons, illicit drugs, stolen goods, **counterfeit items, or products subject to mandatory recall.**
    
-   Contain viruses, malicious code, or attempt unauthorised access.
    

**4.3** You must not make any claim or representation about an item that is false, misleading, or deceptive, including but not limited to misrepresenting an item's condition, age, or authenticity. This includes compliance with all relevant product safety standards under the ACL.

**4.4** **Chat System:** We provide an internal chat system solely for the convenience of Users to communicate regarding a Listing. We do not guarantee the permanent storage or security of any communication history. You acknowledge and agree that you may exchange contact information to communicate off-Platform, at which point we assume no responsibility for the privacy, safety, or record of those communications.

**4.5** We may remove or suspend any Listing or content at our sole discretion.

## 5. Intellectual Property

All content on the Website (text, logos, images, software) is owned or licensed by us unless otherwise stated. You may not reproduce, modify, or exploit it without written permission.

By uploading your Listing content (images/text) you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, display, reproduce, and distribute that content in connection with the Platform.

## 6. Payments & Fees

If you choose paid features (e.g., “boost” or “pin to top”), you agree to the applicable pricing and payment terms. All fees are non-refundable except as required by law.

We may change pricing or introduce new features; changes will be notified.

## 7. Dispute Reporting & Enforcement

**7.1** **Reporting:** If you believe another User is violating these Terms or our **Community Guidelines** (e.g., posting prohibited items, engaging in spam, or harassment), you may submit a **Violation Report** to FlyerBoard via our contact form.

**7.2** **Our Action:** FlyerBoard will investigate the reported conduct. Our action is limited to taking disciplinary steps against the User’s account (e.g., warning, suspension, or termination) for breaching these Terms. We will not adjudicate, mediate, or compel a financial remedy for any transaction or dispute between Users.

## 8. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability

**8.1** The Platform is provided “as is” and we make no warranties (express or implied) including fitness for purpose, accuracy of Listings, or availability.

**8.2** To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is excluded for any loss or damage arising from your use of the Website or transactions with other Users.

**8.3** Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability which cannot be excluded under Australian law (e.g., consumer guarantees under ACL).

## 9. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Platform and its officers, directors, and employees from any claim, loss, or demand (including legal costs) arising out of your use of the Website, your Listing, **or any transaction or dispute with another User,** or breach of these Terms.

## 10. Privacy & Data Security

Your use of personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy (see separate document). You agree that we may collect, use and disclose your data as described in that policy.

We take reasonable steps to protect your data; however, we do not guarantee security and you use the Website at your own risk.

## 11. Governing Law & Jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of [State/Territory, e.g., Victoria] and you submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of its courts.

## 12. General

If any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, it will be severed and the rest remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us in respect of your use of the Website.
